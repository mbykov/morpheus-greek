  <p> Morpheus is designed in accordance with the grammars of Aristotle, Dionysius Thax, Apollonius Dyscolus, rather then the modern grammar. Because the use of ancient grammar gives a different result - in the most important issues. Not due to a different meaning of vocabulary, but due to not bringing modern concepts (language, sentence, noun, adjective, etc, etc, etc) into the ancient text.
